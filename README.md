I spend my time solving interesting problems at Spatial Data Logic building out code-driven infrastructure.  I love leveraging tech to solve challenges and enjoy identifying the right tools for the job.  One of my greatest joys is helping people, whether it be at work, at home, with networking, or in any capacity I am able.  If we should connect send me an email or an invite on LinkedIn.  I didn't put the link here because I get enough spam and there's only a couple of us
