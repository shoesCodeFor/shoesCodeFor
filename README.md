## Working hard to do great things

- I'm a software dev living in Corvallis, Oregon
- I love all things software and am a perpetual student
- I'm thrilled to learn new technologies, frameworks and languages
- I spend my free time hacking on IoT devices and trying to make myself a more security minded engineer.  

Hit me up if you need help on an open-source, non-profit or generally interesting project! Seriously ;)

So what's up with my spotty contribution history?  I worked for a company with Gitlab and another that required a company GitHub profile so I haven't done much personal coding in the last 2 year.  I'm starting up a passion project with the FloraSync API for IoT telemetry data.  That's probably my most relevant leisure project right now.
