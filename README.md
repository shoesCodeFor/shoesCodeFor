```wisdom
A narcissist, for example, inspired by the homage paid to great painters may become an art student,
but will not, as a rule, become an artist.

The work itself, as a means to fame, will seem to him too painfully slow;
he will continually be diverted from the effort that is necessary to master technique
by dreams of the splendour that will accrue to him when his technique has been mastered.

He does not sufficiently desire the result to be able to bear with patience the painful years of apprenticeship.

## Working hard to do great things
### Me in 5 bullets
- Proud parent and partner!
- Full-stack software dev living in Wheat Ridge, CO
- Perpetual student. Lover of all things software, systems, programming, and tech(and apparently Oxford commas)

Email me if you need help on an open-source, non-profit, or generally interesting project! Seriously ;)

I spend my time solving interesting problems and building out code-driven infrastructure.  I love leveraging tech to solve challenges and enjoy identifying the right tools for the job.  One of my greatest joys is helping people, whether it be at work, at home, with networking, or in any capacity I am able.  If we should connect send me an email or an invite on LinkedIn.  I didn't put the link here because I get enough spam and there's only a couple of us 😜
