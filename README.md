## Working hard to do great things
### Me in 5 bullets
- Proud parent and partner!
- Full-stack software dev living in Corvallis, Oregon
- Perpetual student. Lover of all things software, systems, prgramming, and tech(and apparently Oxford commas)

Hit me up if you need help on an open-source, non-profit or generally interesting project! Seriously ;)

I spend my time solving interesting problems at Spatial Data Logic building out code-driven infrastructure.  I love leveraging tech to solve challenges and enjoy identifying the right tool for the job.  One of my greatest joys is helping people, whether it be at work, at home, with networking, or in any capacity I am able.  If you think we should connect send me an email or an invite on LinkedIn.  I didn't put the link here because I get enough spam and there's only a couple of us
